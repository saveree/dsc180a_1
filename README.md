# Data Ingestion - Assignment 1: 

**Background**: 
After close analysis of Piet Mondrian's paintings, analysts noticed a trend - his style of art shifted from traditional to more abstract paintings throughout his career. Researcher Alexander Koch wanted to quantify this abstraction, and introduced the principle of a complexity score. 

**Approach**: 
I used python's BeautifulSoup module to webscrape the Catalogue Ressonnae site, which contains most of his works, along with metadata.  

**What's Remaining:**
I need to organize the metadata, such as the dimensions and year of the paintings (given more time).
